## âœ” IMAGE ENCRYPTION DECRYPTION
- An Image Encryption Decryption is an image processing application created in python with tkinter gui and OpenCv library.
- In this application user can select an image and can encrypt that image to gray scale image and can even decrpyt also.
- Also after encrypting and decrypting user can also save the edited image anywhere in the local system.
- Also there is option to reset to the original image.

****

### HOW TO Use it :
- User just need to download the file, and run the image_encryption_decryption.py, on local system.
- After running a GUI window appears, where user needs to choose an image file using CHOOSE button on the top right corner.
- After selecting the image, two images will appear on screen one on left side, which is original and one on write in which Encrypted Decrypted format will be shown.
- Now user can start encryption and decryption using Encrypt and Decrypt button.
- After editing user can also save the edited image to any location in local system using SAVE button.
- Also there is a RESET button, clicking on which resets the edited image to original format.
- Also there is exit button, clicking on which we get a exit dialog box asking the permission to exit.
